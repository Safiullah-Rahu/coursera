Myself, Sai Nikhil and I work as a Full Stack Engineer at Hitachi Vantara, Hyderabad and as part of my work, I am involved in the development of a Data Catalog tool named Waterline Data. My job also involves work related to the development of RESTful APIs for consuming the data catalog services and my tech stack is Java, J2EE, Jersey, Jetty, Solr, Apache Spark technologies.

I completed my undergraduate education in Civil Engineering in May 2013 from a reputed institution in India, Indian Institute of Technology - Kharagpur (IIT Kharagpur). Even though my major was Civil Engineering, my major interest since childhood is in the subject of mathematics and this steered my interest towards learning Data Structure and Algorithms course. I started my career as an R&D Engineer at Altair Engineering (Kindly, refer to my personal website http://saint1729.me for more info on my education and employment) and to date, I have a great passion for learning new stuff in the field of Computer Science.

I have completed Prof. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course in 36 days and achieved 100% grade. Apart from this I completed courses "Algorithm Toolbox (UC San Diego)", "HTML, CSS and JavaScript (HKUST)", "Web UI Frameworks (HKUST)", "Object-Oriented Design (University of Alberta)", "Linear Algebra" by Prof. Gilbert Strang (from MIT OCW), "Introductions to Algorithms" by Prof. Charles Leiserson & Prof. Eric Demaine (from MIT OCW).

I currently earn X amount salary, of which

    -> 0.3 X goes to tax cuttings (as per govt. rule in my country)
    -> 0.27 X goes to EMI payment of a new house which has been gifted to my parents recently
    -> 0.3 X goes to my living and expenses (includes rent, food, travel, etc.,), as I stay at a place far away from my hometown.
    -> 0.13 X of the money goes to savings.

My company policy does not include reimbursing for online MOOC learning.

I can do content editing and assistantship to course by putting extra effort into grading peers' assignments. I can actively participate in group discussions and share/gain knowledge by clarifying/reading peer posts. I will follow the Coursera terms and conditions and I am totally against code plagiarism and would complete the coursework honestly with my sincere effort.

I have applied for MS in Applied Mathematics program (Fall 2020) and got an admit from Stevens Institute of Technology. I want to complete a few courses in advance, before going to university as it can help to start from a point greater than zero once I go to university.

I want to complete the entire specialization. Once I complete this course with full dedication, I will come back and apply for financial aid for the subsequent courses in this specialization.
