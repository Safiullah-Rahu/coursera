Myself, Sai Nikhil and I work as a full time employee at Waterline Data, Hyderabad and as part of my work I am involved in development of a Data Catalog tool useful for Data Profiling. My job also involves work related to development of RESTful APIs for consuming the data catalog services and these are written using Java, J2EE, Jersey, Jetty, Solr, Apache Spark technologies.

I completed my undergraduate education in Civil Engineering in May 2013 from a reputed instituion in India, Indian Institute of Technology - Kharagpur (IIT Kharagpur). Right from childhood, my major interest is in subject of mathematics which steered my interest towards learning Data Structure and Algorithms course. I started my career as an R&D Engineer at Altair Engineering (Kindly, refer to my personal website http://saint1729.me for more info on my education and employment) and till date I have great passion towards learning new stuff in field of Computer Science.

I have completed Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course in 36 days and achieved 100% grade. Apart from this I completed courses "Algorithm Toolbox (UC San Diego)", "HTML, CSS and JavaScript (HKUST)", "Web UI Frameworks (HKUST)", "Object-Oriented Design (University of Alberta)".

I earn X amount salary, of which

    -> 0.3 X goes to tax cuttings (as per govt. rule in my country)
    -> 0.27 X goes to EMI payment of a new house which has been gifted to my parents recently
    -> 0.3 X goes to my living and expenses (includes rent, food, travel etc.,), as I stay at a place far away from my hometown.
    -> 0.13 X of the money goes to savings.

My company policy does not include reimbursing for online MOOC learning.

I can do content editing and assistantship to course by putting extra effort in grading peers assignments. I can actively participate in group discussions and share/gain knowledge by clarifying/reading peer posts. I will follow the Coursera terms and conditions and I am totally against code plagiarism, and would complete the coursework honestly with my sincere effort.


Since my current job involves work with Big Data, I found this particular course could help me in learning basics and ramp up at my workplace sooner.

I want to complete the entire specialization. Once I complete this course with full dedication, I will comeback and apply for a financial aid for the subsequent courses in this specialization.
