I am currently pursuing an MS in Applied Mathematics program (Fall 2020) at Northeastern University. I want to complete a few courses in summer break so that they can help me in cracking tough technical interviews, once I complete the education.

I already completed the courses "Machine Learning" (Andrew Ng), "Algorithmic Toolbox", and a specialization, "Mathematics for Data Science" which contains 4 courses, 3 courses in Deep Learning specialization. This application is for financial aid for the course "Generalized Linear Models and Nonparametric Regression".

My long-term goal is to end up as a Data Scientist or an ML Engineer at a leading tech/finance company. This course looks like the right choice as it helps me in gaining good knowledge in understanding the Statistics concepts which are very helpful for applied part of Machine Learning role once I start my job.

Machine Learning/Data Science is my new area of interest. I completed Andrew Ng's "Machine Learning" course on Coursera, but couldn't get a chance to deploy it in a distributed environment. This course can also help me cover the core required before I can start the implementation of these techniques after I land at my dream company.
