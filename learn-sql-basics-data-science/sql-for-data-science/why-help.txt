My name is Sai Nikhil. I am currently pursuing graduate education is Applied Mathematics at Northeastern University. I previously worked at Hitachi, Oracle and Altair Engineering where as part of my work, I was involved in different areas of development like Image Processing, Optical Character Recognition, Enterprise Application Development, etc.,

I completed my undergraduate education in Civil Engineering in May 2013 from a reputed institution in India, Indian Institute of Technology - Kharagpur (IIT Kharagpur). Even though my major was Civil Engineering, my primary interest since childhood is in the subject of mathematics and this steered my interest towards learning Data Structure and Algorithms course. I started my career as an R&D Engineer at Altair Engineering (Kindly, refer to my personal website http://saint1729.me for more info on my education and employment) and to date, I have a great passion for learning new stuff in the field of Computer Science.

I have completed Prof. Andrew Ng's "Machine Learning" course in 36 days and achieved 100% grade. Apart from this I completed courses "Algorithm Toolbox", "Discrete Math and Analyzing Social Graphs", "Calculus and Optimization for Machine Learning", "First Steps in Linear Algebra for Machine Learning", "Probability Theory and Statistics" from Coursera.

I am currently a student and have no source of income. I can do content editing and assistantship to course by putting extra effort into grading peers' assignments. I can actively participate in group discussions and share/gain knowledge by clarifying/reading peer posts. I will follow the Coursera terms and conditions and I am totally against code plagiarism and would complete the coursework honestly with my sincere effort.

I would likt to enter Data Science field after my graduate education. I want to complete a few courses in advance, so that they will help me crack the tough technical interviews.
