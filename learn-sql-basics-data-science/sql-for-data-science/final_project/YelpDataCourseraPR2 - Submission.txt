Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = id (primary): 10000
ii. Hours = business_id (foreign): 1562
iii. Category = business_id (foreign): 2643
iv. Attribute = business_id (foreign): 1115
v. Review = id (primary): 10000, business_id (foreign): 8090, user_id (foreign): 9581
vi. Checkin = business_id (foreign): 493
vii. Photo = id (primary): 10000, business_id (foreign): 6493
viii. Tip = business_id (foreign): 3979, user_id (foreign): 537
ix. User = id (primary): 10000
x. Friend = user_id (foreign): 11
xi. Elite_years = user_id (foreign): 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:
	no
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	select (case all_null_count when 0 then 'no' else 'yes' end) as nulls_present from (select (sum(case id when null then 1 else 0 end)
+ sum(case name when null then 1 else 0 end)
+ sum(case review_count when null then 1 else 0 end)
+ sum(case yelping_since when null then 1 else 0 end)
+ sum(case useful when null then 1 else 0 end)
+ sum(case funny when null then 1 else 0 end)
+ sum(case cool when null then 1 else 0 end)
+ sum(case fans when null then 1 else 0 end)
+ sum(case average_stars when null then 1 else 0 end)
+ sum(case compliment_hot when null then 1 else 0 end)
+ sum(case compliment_more when null then 1 else 0 end)
+ sum(case compliment_profile when null then 1 else 0 end)
+ sum(case compliment_cute when null then 1 else 0 end)
+ sum(case compliment_list when null then 1 else 0 end)
+ sum(case compliment_note when null then 1 else 0 end)
+ sum(case compliment_plain when null then 1 else 0 end)
+ sum(case compliment_cool when null then 1 else 0 end)
+ sum(case compliment_funny when null then 1 else 0 end)
+ sum(case compliment_writer when null then 1 else 0 end)
+ sum(case compliment_photos when null then 1 else 0 end)) as all_null_count
from user) x;

	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg:	3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg:	3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:	0	max:	2	avg:	0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:	1	max:	53	avg:	1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min:	0	max:	2000	avg:	24.2995
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

|   3.5 |     3 |
|   4.0 |     2 |
|   4.5 |     1 |
|   5.0 |     1 |
+-------+-------+


ii. Beachwood

SQL code used to arrive at answer:

select b.stars
, count(b.stars) as count
from business b
where city = 'Beachwood'
group by b.stars;

Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns – star rating and count):

+-------+-------+
| stars | count |
+-------+-------+
|   2.0 |     1 |
|   2.5 |     1 |
|   3.0 |     2 |
|   3.5 |     2 |
|   4.0 |     1 |
|   4.5 |     2 |
|   5.0 |     5 |
+-------+-------+		


7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:
		
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
select u.id
, u.name
, u.review_count
from user u
order by u.review_count desc limit 3;

		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

+------------------------+--------+--------------+
| id                     | name   | review_count |
+------------------------+--------+--------------+
| -G7Zkl1wIWBBmD0KRy_sCw | Gerald |         2000 |
| -3s52C4zL_DHRK0ULG6qtg | Sara   |         1629 |
| -8lbUNlXVSoXqaRRiHiSNg | Yuri   |         1339 |
+------------------------+--------+--------------+


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

select u.review_count as x
, u.fans as y
from user u
order by x desc;

No. Reviews and fans do not correlate with each other. Although, not much data is available we can see the first few rows below:


+------+-----+
|    x |   y |
+------+-----+
| 2000 | 253 |
| 1629 |  50 |
| 1339 |  76 |
| 1246 | 101 |
| 1215 | 126 |
| 1153 | 311 |
| 1116 |  16 |
| 1039 | 104 |
|  968 | 497 |
|  930 | 173 |
|  904 |  38 |
|  864 |  43 |
|  862 | 124 |
|  861 | 115 |
|  842 |  85 |
|  836 |  37 |
|  834 | 120 |
|  813 | 159 |
|  775 |  61 |
|  754 |  78 |
|  702 |  35 |
|  696 |  10 |
|  694 | 101 |
|  676 |  25 |
|  675 |  45 |
+------+-----+
(Output limit exceeded, 25 of 10000 total rows shown)


Calculating the correlation for two columns x and y from the above table by using the formula

correlation = (average(x * y) - average(x) * average(y)) / (standard_deviation(x) * standard_deviation(y))

we can see that it is much less than < 1. Hence, the two columns are not correlated.

Also, looking at the values also it is clear that for higher values of x, we don't always have higher values of y.

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer:

There are more reviews with the word 'love'. Number of reviews containing the word 'love' are 1780 and those containing 'hate' are 232.

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

select count(s1) counts from
(select r.text as s1
from review r
where s1 like '%love%') x
union all
select count(s2) counts from
(select r.text as s2
from review r
where s2 like '%hate%') y;



10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

select u.id
, u.name
, u.fans
from user u
order by u.fans desc limit 10;


	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

+------------------------+-----------+------+
| id                     | name      | fans |
+------------------------+-----------+------+
| -9I98YbNQnLdAmcYfb324Q | Amy       |  503 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

The city I took is 'Las Vegas' and category I chose is 'Restaurants'. Yes, there is a different distribution of hours. From the following output, we can infer that restaurants in Las Vegas who are operating till late in the night seem to have less over all rating than those closing early.

+---------------+-----------+-------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
| star_category | city      | category    | name                | hours                 |

| 4-5           | Las Vegas | Restaurants | Jacques Cafe        | Wednesday|11:00-20:00 |
+---------------+-----------+-------------+---------------------+-----------------------+


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

The city I took is 'Las Vegas' and category I chose is 'Restaurants'. Yes. We have approximately 8 times 4-5 star reviews when compared to 2-3 star reviews.

+---------------+------------------+
| star_category | review_count_sum |
+---------------+------------------+
| 2-3           |              123 |
| 4-5           |              939 |
+---------------+------------------+


iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.


+---------------+---------------------+---------------------------------+--------------+-------------+----------+-----------+
| star_category | name                | address                         | neighborhood | postal_code | latitude | longitude |
+---------------+---------------------+---------------------------------+--------------+-------------+----------+-----------+
| 2-3           | Wingstop            | 5045 W Tropicana Ave            |              | 89103       |  36.1003 |   -115.21 |

+---------------+---------------------+---------------------------------+--------------+-------------+----------+-----------+

The location details from 'Las Vegas' for different 'Restaurants' is provided in the above table. 




SQL code used for analysis:

i)
select (case when b.stars >= 2.0 and b.stars <= 3.0 then '2-3'
        when b.stars >= 4.0 and b.stars <= 5.0 then '4-5'
        else 0 end) star_category
, b.city
, c.category
, b.name
, h.hours
from business b, category c, hours h
where b.city = 'Las Vegas'
and c.category = 'Restaurants'
and b.id = h.business_id
and b.id = c.business_id
order by star_category, h.hours;



ii)

select (case when b.stars >= 2.0 and b.stars <= 3.0 then '2-3'
        when b.stars >= 4.0 and b.stars <= 5.0 then '4-5'
        else 0 end) star_category
, sum(b.review_count) review_count_sum
from business b, category c

and b.id = c.business_id
group by star_category
having star_category in ('2-3', '4-5')
order by star_category;


iii)

select distinct (case when b.stars >= 2.0 and b.stars <= 3.0 then '2-3'
        when b.stars >= 4.0 and b.stars <= 5.0 then '4-5'
        else 0 end) star_category
, b.name
, b.address
, b.neighborhood
, b.postal_code
, b.latitude
, b.longitude

where b.city = 'Las Vegas'
and c.category = 'Restaurants'
and b.id = h.business_id
and b.id = c.business_id
order by star_category;



		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1


+---------+---------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
| is_open |  avg(b.stars) | avg(b.review_count) | sum(b.review_count) | count(b.review_count) |
+---------+---------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
|       0 | 3.52039473684 |       23.1980263158 |               35261 |                  1520 |
|       1 | 3.67900943396 |       31.7570754717 |              269300 |                  8480 |
+---------+---------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+

From the above table we can infer that, average review count for closed businesses is less than those of open businesses. Also, total number of reviews for closed businesses is less than that of open businesses.


ii. Difference 2:


select b.is_open
, avg(distinct_attr)
from business b, (select business_id
, count(distinct name) distinct_attr from attribute
group by business_id) a
where b.id = a.business_id
group by b.is_open;

+---------+--------------------+
| is_open | avg(distinct_attr) |
+---------+--------------------+
|       0 |      10.7857142857 |
|       1 |      8.71232876712 |
+---------+--------------------+

From the above table we can see that average number of distinct attributes provided by a business is relatively high for closed businesses when compared to open businesses with which one can infer that a business is closed because of providing more number of attributes.



SQL code used for analysis:

Code for Difference 1:

select b.is_open, avg(b.stars)
, avg(b.review_count)
, sum(b.review_count)
, count(b.review_count)
from business b
group by b.is_open;


Code for Difference 2:

select b.is_open
, avg(distinct_attr)
from business b, (select business_id
, count(distinct name) distinct_attr from attribute
group by business_id) a
where b.id = a.business_id
group by b.is_open;


	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

I would like to predict the overall star rating for a business.


ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

Suppose we want to open a new business and predict the average rating for it over time. Because the overall star rating for a business can depend on different factors such as location, star rating for existing businesses, business category, attributes, hours provided by the business we might want to choose the columns neighborhood, latitude, longitude, stars from business table, category from category table, name from attribute table, hours from hours table.

Because the location of a business such as restaurant will have impact on the rating we chose the location features latitude and longitude. Sometimes, the neighbourhood of an area can have a negative impact on the overall rating of a business. Thus we need the string column neighborhood. This needs to be converted to categorical column using tehcniques such as one-hot encoding. The business category is another important feature because the average rating of a certain business category can be only high in a locality because it is famous in that location. There can also some correlation between attributes provided by a business with the average rating and similarly the total number of operating hours.

Using all the above columns we can use techniques such as Linear Regression to predict the average rating for a new restaurant because all the features taken into consideration are available right from the start of the business. 

iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+----------+-----------+-------------------------------+-------+----------+------+-------+
| latitude | longitude | neighborhood                  | stars | category | name | hours |
+----------+-----------+-------------------------------+-------+----------+------+-------+

iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:


I am using left join here because I want to include null values also. It is upto data exploration team to filter the unnecessary fields out.

select b.latitude
, b.longitude
, b.neighborhood
, b.stars
, c.category
, a.name
, h.hours
from business b
left join attribute a on b.id = a.business_id
left join category c on b.id = c.business_id
left join hours h on b.id = h.business_id;
