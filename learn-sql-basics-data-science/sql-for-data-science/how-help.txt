I am currently pursuing MS in Applied Mathematics program (Fall 2020) at Northeastern University. I want to complete a few courses in winter break so that they can help me in cracking tough technical interviews, once I complete the education.

I already completed the courses "Machine Learning" (Andrew Ng), "Algorrithmic Toolbox", and a specialization, "Mathematics for Data Science" which contains 4 courses. This application is for financial aid for the course "SQL for Data Science".

My long term goal is to end up as a Data Scientist or an ML Engineer at a leading tech / finance company. This course looks like the right choice as it helps me in gaining good knowledge in SQL which is one of the core subjects required for passing Data Science interviews.

Machine Learning/Data Science is my new area of interest. I completed Andrew Ng's "Machine Learning" course on Coursera, but couldn't get a chance to deploy it in a distributed environment. This course can help me cover the core required before I can start the implementation of these techniques after I land at my dream job.
